## Installing and Using a 4D Project

### Pre-requisites

* **OpenAI API Key**: This demo requires an OpenAI API key.  
  - You can generate one by creating an account at: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)  
  - **Best practices for API key usage**:
    - Never share your key publicly (e.g., in GitHub repositories).
    - Store the key securely (use environment variables or a config file not under version control).
    - Monitor your usage on the OpenAI dashboard to avoid unexpected charges.
    - Consider setting usage limits or alerts on your OpenAI account.
